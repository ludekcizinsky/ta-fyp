## üíø Environment setup
### General goals
While this exercise might seem very easy, please do spend time
on setting up your coding environment properly. By properly,
I mean that you are able to do the following things **quickly**
- Run whole `R` script or just part of it and view the output
- See plots
- Save plots

Further, you should setup a directory where you will store your work.
You can take inspiration from mine. Ideally, you make a repository
so you can version control your work. üê±

Below, I specify my personal setup which is *slightly* bit more
difficult to setup compare to just downloading `RStudio`. 

### My personal setup
I personally use `VS code` since it can be used for many other languages 
including `Python`, `C++` or `Java`. (all of which you will encounter in the future)

To use `R` with `VS code`, you can simply follow this tutorial. ([Mac]https://github.com/REditorSupport/vscode-R/wiki/Installation:-macOS(),
 [Win](https://github.com/REditorSupport/vscode-R/wiki/Installation:-Windows))

 To then execute whole or just part of the script, I highlight
 the given piece of code and press `cmd + enter` (mac) or `ctrl + enter` (win).
